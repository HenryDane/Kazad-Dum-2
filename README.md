This is a simple game -- my second game ever and my first to use both Java and OpenGL at the same time. It is not very well written but (for me) that is acceptable. If you have any ideas for optimization or repair or noticed a bug, let me know. I only put this up so that my friends can see my code and point out its many faults. Enjoy?
